# MagneticMaterialsOntology

Ontology for magnetic materials
===============================
An EMMO-based ontology for magnetic materials.

Status
------
- [X] Proposal
- [ ] Accepted, under development
- [ ] Official

This ontology is work-in-progress (WIP).

* Application submitted: December 2024
* Application accepted on: TBD


Imported ontologies
-------------------
This ontology builds on top of [EMMO](https://github.com/emmo-repo/EMMO) [^1]. See the following table for version
compatibilies:

| Imported Ontologies  | Version             |      |
| -------------------- | --------------------| --------- |
| [EMMO](https://github.com/emmo-repo/EMMO)  | 1.0.0-RC3 compacted | https://emmo-repo.github.io/versions/1.0.0-rc3/emmo.ttl |


Using
-----

You may view the ontology by browsing through the [html documentation](https://mammos-project.github.io/MagneticMaterialsOntology/doc/magnetic_material_mammos.html)

Alternatively you can use [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/)
* Install Protégé
* Download the file `magnetic_material_mammos.ttl`  
  Click on the file  
  Select the icon for `Downloading raw file` 
* Start Protégé and open the magnetic materials ontololgy
  File --> Open magnetic_material_mammos.ttl 
* Run the Reasoner  
  Reasoner --> select HermiT  
  Reasoner --> Start reasoner 
* Navigate  
  Open the Classes Tab (Window --> Tab: select Classes)  
  Select Inferred at the top right pull down menu of the Classes Tab  
  Use Ctrl-F (Edit --> Find) to search for a term for example type "Magnet"
* Visualize the knowledge tree  
  Open the OntoGraf Tab (Window --> Tab: select OntoGraf)  
  Select an entity in the Classes Tab to visualize
* Reset view (if something goes wrong)  
  Window --> Reset selected tab to default state
  
Building
--------

MagneticMaterialsOntology is built using tools provided by EMMO. For more details see the [src directory](https://github.com/MaMMoS-project/MagneticMaterialsOntology/tree/main/src)

Installation of required software is also explained in  [src/README.md](https://github.com/MaMMoS-project/MagneticMaterialsOntology/tree/main/src/README.md)
